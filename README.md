# VLSI-Shared
This repo contains some of the VLSI projects that I have worked on. Some of the tools that I have Utilized
are Cadance Virtuoso and Genus. Also, some open sources such as OpenROAD project.

Disclaimer
This repository is dedicated to projects that I can openly share, as most of my work has been in academic education. 
Access to the private repository will be granted upon request and exclusively to prospective employers for all the 
projects I have been involved in.
